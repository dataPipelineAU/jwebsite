This survey aims to collect data on how small businesses are using data within their organisation, and the limitations they have in doing so.
The survey is short, and can be completed in just a few minutes, and you can choose to be anonymous.
It is deliberately not asking for lots of in-depth information about your business, feel free to give approximate answers to the business size or location questions.
I'd ask that your location be at least to the state level, if you choose not to give your exact location.

If you leave your contact details, we will initially contact you to discuss your answers and the direction that you want to go with your business.

Thanks for assisting us with developing better resources and products for small data analytics.
