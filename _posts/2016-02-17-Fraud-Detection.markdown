<Title> The future of fraud detection </title>

Fraud has always been a major problem for many sectors, including obvious ones such as banking, government welfare, grants, charities and so on.

Less obvious ones include, well, all of us.
Whether that includes small business owners who get hit with fraudulent invoices, or customers who get their credit cards skimmed at a register, the threat of fraud affects us all.

Luckily, the field of fraud detection is growing rapidly, with more insightful algorithms coming out regularly, including from the public sector from researchers such as those from the [Internet Commerce Security Laboratory](http://federation.edu.au/icsl).
These researchers are developing new techniques for profiling and detecting fraud.
There is also an industry sector eager to take these findings and put them into practice, resulting in fraud detection products usable by you and I.

[As identified by John Verver](http://www.acfe.com/uploadedfiles/acfe_website/content/canadian/2013/presentations/9d-john-verver-cpp.pdf), data analysis has a key role to play in fraud detection and the techniques are improving quite dramatically.

Most people have some experience with fraud detection, even if it is a second-hand account of a friend who was called by their bank to ask if a transaction on their account was legitimate.
Behind the scenes, algorithms and experts work together to look for rules that identify normal and abnormal behaviour of fraud.
This is data mining in practice, where those patterns are then codified into a filter that searches through transactions and finds those transactions likely to be fraudulent.

The Australian Taxaction Office is building (and using) systems that model the behaviour of taxpayers and using those models to look for abnormal behaviour.
This includes how taxpayers interact.
In the past, this would be seen as "too large" a problem, which is why the tax office has focused on different types of taxpayers (such as tradies) in different years, rather than everyone, every year.
However, I estimate that very quickly (say, 5 years), organisations like the ATO would be able to model significant portions of Australia's economy, leading to a situation where tax fraud is very difficult to hide.

<h3>Human-Algorithm Interaction</h3>

<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/centrelink-investigators-nab-welfare-cheats-via-social-media-20160203-gmkv2b.html"> Recent news<a/> articles have talked about the use of social media to find those defrauding welfare systems. 
In one example, a couple were each obtaining a single's benefit, despite obviously being in a long-term relationship (they lived together and just announced a pregnancy).
In many cases, this sort of thing is done manually based on a tip-off.
Someone calls in a suspected fraudster and the welfare agency investigates.

This type of investigation can benefit from an automated analysis, even if it does only part of the work.
For instance, rules can be set up to look for patterns such as "frequent postings with another person on single's payment" to look for this kind of fraud.
Such systems are probably not yet advanced enough to automatically be judge and jury, although they are definitely smart enough to find "red flags" requiring further investigation.

This type of machine-learning alerting system can take a problem that is too large for a person, such as searching for details of people online, and turning it into a smaller number of specific events to investigate.

Companies that use this type of system should also be on the look out for how they improve over time.
In this sense, the system learns new rules, and has new rules added by people.

This leads to a natural progression where more work is done via the automated system and the people are free to either investigate new forms of fraud or to do other tasks (such as building new products).
As this happens, the company does more with existing sources and becomes more profitable, modern and robust.
