<Title> Insight from external data </title>

Data analysis insight doesn't just come from using data your organisation has created.
While much of our knowledge looks internally, there are substantial gains to be had in our understanding of the world, and your business sector, but looking outward.
These external datasets can come from others in your industry, government organisations, third party organisations, researchers and so on.

Using external data sources has an odd synergy with competitors.
While having internal data provides your company with an advantage that others do not have (because they don't have the same information), external data is often publicly available.
This means that to have an advantage, you need to have better analysis tools and better integration with your internal data and expertise.

It might surprise many, but the Australian government has an extensive number of datasets available, such as through [data.gov.au](http://data.gov.au).
Below we outline some example datasets from the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](http://www.abs.gov.au/), which are publicly available for all businesses to use.


<a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/8731.0"><b>Building Approvals</b></a>

Extensive information is released on the number, location, and types of building approvals each month.
This type of data can be useful for organisations to find fast moving areas, new types of businesses being built, and other information about the location they conduct business in.



<a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4530.0"><b>Crime Victimisation</b></a>
Crime is a big indicator of demographic information such as income and business viability in an area.
Knowing crime statistics for an area can assist in determining whether to expand into a new area.
Conversely, if your business is in providing security, these might be the exact areas you are looking for.

From their page:
<quote>
The survey collected data, via personal interview, about peopleâ€™s experiences of crime victimisation for a selected range of personal and household crimes. The survey also collected data about whether persons experiencing crime reported these incidents to police, selected characteristics of persons experiencing crime, and selected characteristics of the most recent incident they experienced.

<a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6202.0"><b>Labour Force</b></a>
Probably the most talked about dataset of ABS, the current trends of employment are newsworthy even if they don't change.
It provides a general indicator of the expansion of business, a predictor of future customer sentiment, and much more.
One important use is to help predict the outcome of elections -- if employment is down, it is more likely that the government would be changed.
Also on this page is some analysis of the general trend, without getting too political in insight.


<a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6401.0/"><b>Consumer Price Index</b></a>
The CPI (Consumer Price Index) records the percentage change in the cost of many goods, broken down by different sectors.
Prices are also seasonally adjusted to provide a better direct comparison per quarter, and data is provided for a long time period.



Overall, these datasets (and many, many more) can help your business to obtain external insight, providing direction for your business.
Integrating these datasets provides both technical and business challenges, but overall the outcome will benefit your business.
