Automation can provide significant gains for your business. Even difficult tasks can be automated, with the effects impacting all industries including real estate, catering, manufacturing, or software development.

Data analytics can help to automate many tasks, specifically tasks that are related to decision making from past knowledge.
In this sense, data analytics *codifies* existing knowledge that you or your businesses have, turning it into software that can make those decisions for you, faster and more scalable than previously possible.
Recent advances in algorithms have meant that many businesses can now run with a fraction of the staffing resources they used to need.
This automation frees staff from more monotonous work, allowing businesses to use, freeing those staff (who often have extensive experience in the industry sector) to work on new opportunities for the business. This cycle of opportunity-development-automation allows businesses to grow and evolve over time while keeping staff engaged and active in the business. All the while, the automated business ventures are still working earning more passive income for the business.

One example of a business benefiting from automation is used-car buying and selling.
Thanks to automation, many online businesses have appeared that can take details about your car and offer a buying price based on internal information about different car types.
Included in this model are adjustments for risk (i.e. cars that are more likely to have been in an accident), profit level (an adjustable parameter), and accounting for the time spent needing to pick up a car. The customer gets an instant price online, and then all the business needs to do is to send someone out to actually get the car - and even scheduling this can be automated!
Insurance agencies also use this model to provide quotes for property, businesses and cars.

It is important to note that not all automation is the same.
As business continues to leverage automation, it is the expertise that goes into building those automated processes that will help one business stand out from the rest.
Your domain expertise, combined with our technical expertise can help automate tasks with a high accuracy and effectiveness.
This domain expertise is also helpful for improving the model, so that it can learn from new scenarios, and also improve the quality of the decision in known scenarios.


Thinking about your business, what are some of the possibilities for automation? Here are some general attributes of tasks that indicate they can probably be automated:
<li> Does it involve summarising large amounts of text?</li>
<li> Does the person doing the task need to perform the same action (physical or mental) many times?</li>
<li> Can the process be outlined sufficiently enough to give to a new staff member (including new staff members with experience in the industry)?</li>
<li> Is the task monotonous in nature? While it might be an odd criteria, "boring tasks" can often be automated in this way.</li>
<li> Do you have a history of data, mapping decisions or actions made, to the outcome they produced?</li>
<li> Does it involve taking data from one source, filtering or altering it, and storing it somewhere else? Examples include electronic filing, measurement analysis, or parsing outputs from a machine.</li>
<br>
If you answered yes to any of those, there is a good chance it can be automated.
At dataPipeline, we are always looking for new ways to bring automation through data analytics to small businesses, helping them grow and achieve more.
Recent examples include predicting staff requirements [blog](http://datapipeline.com.au/case_study/case/study/cafe/2015/09/29/case-study-small-business.html), reading large amounts of text to get general trends [blog](http://datapipeline.com.au/datapipeline/information/2015/06/02/small-business-using-data-analytics.html), and integrating different data feeds into a single report.

You might have ideas about tasks in your business that could be automated.
If so, we are interested to hear more, and can help take you from idea to conception.
Even if you just have a thought, we are happy to give initial guidance on whether it is possible, and what the plan could look like.
Just send an email with your name, contact details, and a short description of your need to [contact@datapipeline.com.au](mailto:contact@datapipeline.com.au) and we will contact you back with a plan of action.
