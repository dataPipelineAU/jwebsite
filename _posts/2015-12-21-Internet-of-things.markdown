<Title> The Internet Of Things </title>

<h2> What is the Internet of Things (IoT)? </h2>

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next big wave of technology, after the current trend of mobile devices.
It is growing very fast, and by 2025 it is predicted that most business sectors will be using it in some way or another.

What is this internet of things anyway?
Well it is really quite simple. The IoT is the connection of devices that talk to each other, from light switches, doors,  cars, even whole cities!
It can be just about anything - you connect these things to the internet and then be able to gather data or perform actions with these devices.
The increase in data will be quite dramatic, but so too willl the increase in possibilities arising from it.
Dr.Jhon Barrett explains the internet of things in his [TED talk](https://youtu.be/QaTIt1C5R-M).

As an example, there is a company named Automatic who have [designed an adapter and an app for your smart phone to be used in the car](https://www.automatic.com/home/).
The adapter is plugged into your car, which then it will relay information back to the app on your phone about your car, from fuel usage and costs, distance driven, and even diagnostic information!
If an engine light appears, the adapter sends a message via Bluetooth to your phone explaining what is wrong with the engine and what you might be able to do to fix the issue.
Of course, this is only a small example of what can be done with the internet of things.

As the internet of things continues to grow, it will greatly benefit business.
Let's say you are a farmer, and you have animals on that farm and the animals that need water.
You could deploy sensors that monitor the temperature, humidity, soil water and so on.
Each sensor pushes this information to a central server, which can alert the farmer if they need to water today or not.

Sensors will be the main resource of data for at least the next few years of the internet of things.
With them, a huge amount of new possibilites arise from traffic control, heart monitor control, self contacting emergency services appliances like fire alarms, and many more.
All of this sounds great! However it is not without its drawbacks.
Security will be a major issue with the internet of thing and with its coming business owners will now more than ever want to be making sure they have the best and most up to date security software.
If everything is connected to the internet then attackers have more access points into your systems, and are able to target databases, private documents and even camera footage would be accessible. 
Many new internet-enabled systems have had such exploits, ranging from [home monitors](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476599/cybercrime-hacking/black-hat-nest-thermostat-turned-into-a-smart-spy-in-15-seconds.html) to even [Barbies](http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/hello-barbie-security-concerns_565c4921e4b072e9d1c24d22?section=australia).

Despite these challenges, businesses will be increasingly using IoT for connectivity, device-to-device communication and automation, and improving their service offerings.
With this comes a raft of possibilities arising from performing data analysis on this data.
