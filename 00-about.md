dataPipeline is a company built on the vision to bring data analytics to small and medium businesses.
As part of that vision, we aim to help businesses with the whole "pipeline" of data-related activities, including:

* Collecting data from real world sources, both internally and externally to your business;
* Storing that data securely and robustly, ensuring that data is kept secret and available;
* Analysing the data to gain actionable insights, allowing your business to benefit from it;
* Reporting and actioning on that data, realising the end-game of your data analytics pipeline.

dataPipeline is a proudly Australian business, operating from the Ballarat region in Victoria.
Incorporated in 2014, the company is only new, but we are helping clients, building products, and making impact.
